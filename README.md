# hello-world
my first repository

i am here as a new student of python.

i will be using my journey as inpiration to create content on github.

the content will be both a sharing of information for other beginners

as well as a way for myself to commit knowledge to memory by reframing

and regurgitating what i am learning. 

thank you for visiting.
